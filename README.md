# Shuttle 2023 Christmas Code Hunt

This repo is the home for my completed solutions for the 2023 Christmas Code Hunt, hosted by [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs).

## Overall Progress

### 2023-12-16
- rebooted with new approach to endpoints router, after discussions on Discord
- re-implemented the "Minus 1" challenge and passed the CCH23 Validator
- had to remove Shuttle, just running a local server spun up within the app

### 2023-12-17
- now working again with Shuttle, thanks to kindness from Discord
- caught up to where the original main branch basically was, in terms of progress
- started to work on Day 11
- dynamic paths still causing lots of difficulty, needed for Days 1 and 8, plus maybe others in the future
